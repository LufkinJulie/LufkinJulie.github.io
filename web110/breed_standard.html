	<h2>Breed Standard</h2>
	<p class ="breed">September 12, 1950, the standards were defined for the Irish Wolfhound. These standards are used for ruling dogs in competition. 
		The Irish Wolfhounds is the largest and tallest of the sight hounds. They are know for their power and swiftness. When an Irish Wolfhound stands up on
		their hind legs they can measure about 7 ft tall. They are a natural breed, meaning their ears are uncropped and tail undocked.
		They are a sighthound that is said to have orginated from large greyhounds,	called vertragus. To save the wolfhound from extistion, 
		these dogs were breed with the biggest Scottish Deerhounds and Great Danes. These two breeds were 
		believed to have been early desendents of the orginal Irish Wolfhound.
